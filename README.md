# food-Review
Fullstack project with Java and SpringBoot. Free to choose project with specific demands on users and functionality. Decided to make a food review similar to a rating page one can find, f.e. Yelp etc.

The program had three users: guest, user, admin with different levels of allowances. Only admins could add a new restaurant, while registered users could review them. Guests could only see what these reviews were and not write them. There was however an option to register and login. Everything added or registered on a page was also saved in a MySQL database.

Made as part of my education.
